# XML to SQL 

## Be sure to git clone this repository into your computer prior to executing the codes.

If necessary, you can comment parts of the codes and uncomment them as you go.

* Pub.db is the result you should get at the end. You can compare your output with this database.

The purpose of this is following:

1. Get familiarized handling XML data. XML is similar to JSON in that it is "semi-structured".
What that means is that certain level of parsing is required prior to importing for data analysis.

2. Get familiarized with SQL. As you have large amount of data, you do not want to rely on just storing data in memory. This will slow you down (and you will lose data when things crash). SQLite3 is a simple tool that's good to use for learning and applying SQL.

3. Get used to handling data in general. Later, you will move to doing analysis in these files as well as plotting figures and whatnot.
